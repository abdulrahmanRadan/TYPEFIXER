# TypeFixer

**TypeFixer** is a VS Code extension designed to help TypeScript developers by suggesting quick fixes for common TypeScript errors and warnings. Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale application, TypeFixer helps you write clean and error-free code by providing helpful recommendations for problematic type declarations.

## Features

- **Quick Fixes for TypeScript Warnings**: TypeFixer currently provides suggestions for avoiding the usage of the `any` type and replacing it with more specific types.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly in the VS Code editor, offering quick fixes as soon as you encounter a TypeScript warning.
- **Extendable**: More warnings and suggestions will be added in future updates to cover additional common errors in TypeScript.

## How to Use

1. Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](#).
2. Open a TypeScript file in your project.
3. When you hover over a warning (e.g., using the `any` type), TypeFixer will provide a quick fix to suggest a more appropriate type.
4. Apply the suggested fix and continue coding without worrying about common type issues!

## Installation

To install TypeFixer, follow these steps:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
3. Search for "TypeFixer" in the marketplace.
4. Click "Install" to install the extension.
5. Once installed, the extension will automatically activate whenever you open a TypeScript file.

## Future Plans

- **Additional Error Suggestions**: We will expand TypeFixer to handle more TypeScript errors and warnings such as unused variables, improper type declarations, and more.
- **Customization Options**: Allow users to configure which errors and warnings they want suggestions for.
